# SOAR-Threat-Response:
SOAR-Integrated Threat Response System for real-time cybersecurity automation.
# SOAR-Integrated Threat Response System

## Overview

The SOAR-Integrated Threat Response System is an open-source cybersecurity platform designed to help organizations detect, investigate, and automatically respond to cyber threats in real-time. It combines multiple powerful tools into one system that works even in low-resource or offline environments, making enterprise-grade security accessible to organizations with limited resources.
## Problem Statement

Ethiopia faces growing cybersecurity threats targeting banks, government agencies, educational institutions, and critical infrastructure. Many organizations lack the budget and staff to maintain a full-time Security Operations Center (SOC). This results in slow threat detection and delayed responses, which increases the risk of damage.

## Solution

This project offers a fully integrated system that:

- Detects suspicious network activity and attacks in real-time using Suricata IDS and Wazuh SIEM.
- Investigates and manages incidents using TheHive platform.
- Runs automated response playbooks via Shuffle SOAR to block attackers, send alerts, and generate reports.
- Includes a machine learning module to detect unusual network behavior.
- Integrates localized Ethiopian threat intelligence feeds to improve detection accuracy.
- Works efficiently even with limited internet access and low system resources.
## Key Features

- Real-time detection of threats such as brute force attempts, port scans, and malware traffic.
- Automated responses including firewall blocking, email and SMS notifications, and incident reporting.
- Centralized monitoring and management of incidents.
- Modular and extendable architecture for easy upgrades and custom playbooks.
- Simulation tools for testing using Kali Linux.

## Technologies Used

- **Suricata IDS** for network threat detection.
- **Wazuh SIEM** for log management and alert correlation.
- **TheHive** for incident response and case management.
- **Shuffle SOAR** for automation and orchestration.
- **Python** for automation scripts and machine learning.
- **Kali Linux** for attack simulation and testing.
- **PostgreSQL / Elasticsearch** for data storage.
## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SOAR-Threat-Response.git
   cd SOAR-Threat-Response
2. Use Docker Compose to set up the system:
   docker-compose up -d
3. Configure each service following the detailed setup guides in the docs folder.
Usage
Use Kali Linux or real network traffic to generate events.

The system will detect suspicious activity, generate alerts, and automatically respond based on predefined playbooks.

Monitor incidents and responses through TheHive dashboard and optional reporting tools.
## Future Work

- Improve the machine learning module for better anomaly detection.
- Add more localized threat intelligence sources.
- Develop a live dashboard for monitoring incidents and responses.
- Expand playbooks to cover more complex attack scenarios.
